      "As director of the Heffner Biomedical Imaging Lab at Columbia, Andrew Laine focuses on the mathematical analysis and quantification of medical images, signal and image processing, computer-aided diagnosis and biomedical / imaging informatics. His work is based on imaging structures at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels of analysis. The goal is to develop biomedical technology for unmet clinical needs and to transition that technology into commercial products that will improve healthcare and save lives.  Laine was the first to use multiscale “wavelet” representation to enhance subtle details in mammograms. Today, the algorithm he developed in 1992 is used in almost all commercial digital mammography systems. Currently, Laine is applying multiresolution wavelet techniques to classify pulmonary emphysema. He is also collaborating on a project in medical informatics to enable clinicians to better diagnose a patient using both text and annotated findings from medical images. Laine’s work draws on such techniques as time-frequency decompositions, speckle tracking, texture analysis, variational segmentation, parametric deformable models, and image reconstructions.\n",
      "Laine received a BS in biological science from Cornell University in 1977, an MS in chemistry from the University of Connecticut in 1980, and a DSc in computer science from Washington University, St. Louis, in 1989. He is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering. He is also a member of Columbia’s Data Science Institute. \n"

      "Sunil K. Agrawal has developed a highly visible interdisciplinary program in rehabilitation robotics involving faculty from School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and College of Physician and Surgeons at Columbia University. Neural disorders, such as stroke and Parkinson’s disease, limit the ability of humans to walk and perform activities of daily living. Pediatric disorders such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and Down’s syndrome delay the development of children and pose many functional limitations. Old age diminishes the sensory and motor systems. Through a range of pilot and clinical studies involving human subjects, Dr. Agrawal has showed that novel training robots can help humans to relearn, restore, or improve functional movements.  Agrawal has active collaborations with faculty in the departments of Neurology, Rehabilitation Medicine, Pediatric Orthopedics, Otolaryngology, Geriatrics, and Psychiatry. A selected list of these ongoing studies are: (i) Perturbation training of the elderly using a Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD), (ii) Gait training of stroke patients with asymmetric forces, (iii) Balance training of children with cerebral palsy, (iv) Gait characterization of patients with vestibular disorders, (v) Balance Training of Parkinson patients, (vi) Novel neck braces for assistance and training of patients with head drop, (vii) Novel dynamic spine braces for patients with scoliosis. These studies are funded by grants from National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Spinal Cord Injury Research Board, and others.\n",
      "Agrawal received a BS in mechanical engineering from IIT, Kanpur (India) in 1984, a MS degree from Ohio State University in 1986, and a PhD degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University, California, in 1990.   He is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE). He is an author of 450 research articles, 3 books, and 13 patents. \n"
