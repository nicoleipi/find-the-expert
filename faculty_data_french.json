Literary ludics, like constraint or procedural writing, approach writing like a game, placing conditions on the language or context of writing. But what could be further\u2014or closer?\u2014to politics than a writing game? The monograph juxtaposes an usual array of case studies, placing three generations of the well-known formalist literary group Oulipo\u2014like Raymond Queneau, Georges Perec, and Jacques Jouet\u2014alongside writers who are not traditionally deemed to be ludic (or even writers!), like the lesbian activist-writer Monique Wittig and the ex-militant editor Fran\u00e7ois Maspero. These authors, all of whom roughly belong to the same generation, which came of age politically during May \u201968 and the Algerian War, deploy ludic or ludic-adjacent methods, like feminizing the French language or cannibalizing intertexts, representing the full spectrum of ludic practice. This transdisciplinary and transhistorical monograph employs mixed methods\u2014including Bourdieusian sociological analysis, archival research, intellectual history, textual philology, and close readings\u2014to examine how and why French authors turn to these ludic methods to grapple with diverse, and often violent, histories. These range from the rise and fall of French feminist and Third-Worldist groups, to the aftermath of international socialism, in the former Parisian Red Belt or in post-Yugoslavia Balkan states. The Politics of Ludics demonstrates that ludic methods serve a few distinct purposes: as a deflection strategy, or a posture or self-presentation, often understood as a means of sidestepping the demands of Sartrean commitment and reframing what it meant to be a \u201cpolitical\u201d author, and as a coded speech, or a means of addressing history indirectly and (more) covertly, outside of the public sphere. Finally, literary ludics functioned as a kind of space travel, or structured movement through the spaces of local and international history.\n ", "Research Embedding": null}, {"Name": "Elisabeth A Ladenson", "Title": "Professor of French and Comparative Literature; General Editor, The Romanic Review", "url": "https://french.columbia.edu/content/elisabeth-ladenson", "Research Summary": "Research Interests \nNineteenth and Twentieth-Century French and comparative literature and cultural history\nElisabeth Ladenson is Professor of French and Comparative Literature and General Editor of Romanic Review.

In both my teaching and my research, I examine the relationship between texts and their various contexts (cultural, social, political, economic).  My work is intrinsically interdisciplinary as I often rely on critical theory, literature, psychoanalysis, and anthropology to examine historical documents, but also as I offer historical analysis as a means to elucidate philosophical questions. I conceive of history not only as way to document the past but also as an invitation to engage in a dialogue with the present.\nMy first book, The Law of Kinship: Anthropology, Psychoanalysis, and the Family in France was published by Cornell University Press and won the 2013 Berkshire Conference of Women Historians Book Prize.  It examines how and why French judges and legislators turned to structuralism \u2013 and more specifically, to some of the most difficult and abstract concepts of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Jacques Lacan \u2013 to reassert the centrality of the heterosexual family in political debates around bioethics, same-sex unions, single-parent households, family names, surrogacy, and adoption.\nMy second book, Disalienation: Politics, Philosophy, and Radical Psychiatry in Postwar France (Chicago, 2021) maps the intersections of politics, philosophy, and radical psychiatry in twentieth-century France.  It focuses on a psychiatric movement called \u201cinstitutional psychotherapy\u201d which had an important influence on many intellectuals and activists, including Fran\u00e7ois Tosquelles, Jean Oury, Felix Guattari, Frantz Fanon, Georges Canguilhem, and Michel Foucault.  Anchored in Marxism and Lacanian psychoanalysis, institutional psychotherapy advocated a fundamental restructuring of the asylum in order to transform the theory and practice of psychiatric care.  More broadly, for many of these thinkers, the asylum could function as a microcosm for society at large and as a space to promote non-hierarchal and non-authoritarian political and social structures.  Psychiatry, they contended, provided a template to better understand alienation and offer perspectives for \u201cdisalienation.\u201d \nI am currently working on a project tentatively titled The War on Gender in which I try to make sense of various arguments that have emerged in recent years against a so-called \u201ctheory of gender,\u201d \u201cgender ideology,\u201d or \u201cgender agenda.\u201d  According to its critics, this \u201cgender ideology\u201d has driven the push for a broad range of sexual and reproductive rights, from the legalization of abortion, access to contraception, same-sex marriage, sexual education in schools, non-discrimination bills, access to new reproductive technologies, trans rights, and much more.  My book traces the discursive origins of this \u201canti-genderism\u201d to various UN conferences in the 1990s and it maps the global circulation of the term, first through the Vatican and its different think tanks, and later through other religious, right-wing, and populist groups.\nI received my B.A. in History and Modern Culture & Media from Brown University in 1999 and my Ph.D. in History from Cornell in 2007.

In each chapter, I turn to a different confluence of birds and human subjects (confluences I propose to call \u201centanglements\u201d) and to what those confluences enabled erotically. In an introduction, I trace the history of the association between birds and love back to classical antiquity but also forward, showing that it endures to this day in our contemporary erotic vocabulary and imaginary. In the rest of the book, I argue that human-avian entanglements made possible: a type of language that foregrounds the corporeal and sensorial over the semantic (chapter 1, \u201cPidgin Poetics\u201d), erotic affects such as desire and pleasure (chapter 2, \u201cThe Wings of Desire\u201d), erotic self-conception and the pivoting of love objects (chapter 3, \u201cThe Falcon as Fulcrum\u201d), and memory of the love object (chapter 4, \u201cMnemonic Birds\u201d).

One is about an Italian expansion and revision of Richard de Fournival\u2019s Bestiaire d\u2019amour and its strategy of self-authorization as the sole authentic version of the Bestiaire (\u201cRemembering to Forget\u201d), another about the suppression of Italian sources and the promotion of French ones in Nicole de Margival\u2019s Dit de la panth\u00e8re (\u201cThe Vernacular Panther\u201d), another about Guillaume de Machaut\u2019s debt to neoplatonism in his general prologue (\u201cThe Genesis of Poetry\u201d), and another about the way in which the reuse of woodcuts from an edition of Aesop\u2019s Fables in a 1547 edition of Rabelais cues that text and its paratext for readers (\u201cRabelais et \u00c9sope en images\u201d).

Atelier interdisciplinaire (and its co-director from 2004 to 2007). I was a freelance writer for the weeklies Le Nouvel Observateur, Elle Magazine and Le Monde des livres.

I curated a year-long Proust festival, helped create Albertine French bookstore, coordinated several yearly French-American Albertine festivals, helped organize an exhibition on Francophone graphic novels at Cooper Union, and organized the first Night of Philosophy in the U.S.  \nIn 2016, when my four-year diplomatic appointment came to an end, I was recruited at Columbia Department of French.

I analyze the shift from declamation to a more visual, body-centered type of performance, at a time when theater was the main form of entertainment. I show how acting was a laboratory for Enlightenment ideas about the relationships between nature, works of art and the audience. By focusing on the body and emotions, acting theory challenged the classical imitation of passions in favor of a more direct expression of emotions. These bold experiments opened the pathways that would be continued by modern theories of performance and the arts. They also constituted a revolutionary exploration of individual identity through a new focus on the living body, and the elevation of acting to an art form and actors and actresses to full citizens.\nCollective Volumes \nEmotions Hit the Stage (16th-21st Century), eds with S.
