His research lies at the intersection of regenerative medicine, stem cells, and skin and endothelial biology and disease. Dr. Abaci’s approach is based on reconstructing the integumentary system in vitro at different levels of complexity through (i) microfluidic- based iPSC-derived organoids, and (ii) 3D-bioprinted advanced skin models and grafts with the motivation to understand, repair and regenerate the skin and its appendages, and with the dream of ultimately matching and achieving beyond the inherent capabilities of human tissues. Dr. Abaci currently serves as the Editorial Board Member of the journal Biomicrofluidics and the Associate Editor of Molecular and Cellular Dermatology.\n"

      "Sunil K. Agrawal has developed a highly visible interdisciplinary program in rehabilitation robotics involving faculty from School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and College of Physician and Surgeons at Columbia University. Neural disorders, such as stroke and Parkinson’s disease, limit the ability of humans to walk and perform activities of daily living. Pediatric disorders such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and Down’s syndrome delay the development of children and pose many functional limitations. Old age diminishes the sensory and motor systems. Through a range of pilot and clinical studies involving human subjects, Dr. Agrawal has showed that novel training robots can help humans to relearn, restore, or improve functional movements.  Agrawal has active collaborations with faculty in the departments of Neurology, Rehabilitation Medicine, Pediatric Orthopedics, Otolaryngology, Geriatrics, and Psychiatry. A selected list of these ongoing studies are: (i) Perturbation training of the elderly using a Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD), (ii) Gait training of stroke patients with asymmetric forces, (iii) Balance training of children with cerebral palsy, (iv) Gait characterization of patients with vestibular disorders, (v) Balance Training of Parkinson patients, (vi) Novel neck braces for assistance and training of patients with head drop, (vii) Novel dynamic spine braces for patients with scoliosis. These studies are funded by grants from National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Spinal Cord Injury Research Board, and others.\n",
      "Agrawal received a BS in mechanical engineering from IIT, Kanpur (India) in 1984, a MS degree from Ohio State University in 1986, and a PhD degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University, California, in 1990.   He is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE). He is an author of 450 research articles, 3 books, and 13 patents. \n"
